Web Development Assignment 2

This is my playframework app gym.

I have implemented all of the features in Excellent 
level, and some of the features in Outstanding level

The app has been deployed at this address: http://gymwebapp-jkelly.herokuapp.com/

The git repository for this app can be found at: https://github.com/KellyJoseph/gymwebapp-josephk

Features I wasn't able to implement in time from the Outstanding category are the trend and the date/time feature.
My git repository has no version history. Outstanding level features I was able to implement were the ability to delete individual assessments
for members, and the ability to delete users for trainers. All the features in Excellent and below are present and fully functional.
